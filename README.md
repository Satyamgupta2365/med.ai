Symptom-based Disease Prediction and Cure Recommendation System
This project is a healthcare application designed to predict diseases based on user-inputted symptoms and provide recommended cures for minor ailments like fever, headache, cold, etc. It serves as a basic diagnostic tool to offer quick advice for common health issues.

Key Features:
Symptom Input: Users can input their symptoms in a natural language format. The system processes these inputs to identify potential diseases.
Disease Prediction: Based on the provided symptoms, the system predicts the most likely disease or health condition using a trained machine learning model. It is capable of mapping multiple symptoms to various common diseases.
Cure Recommendation: For each predicted disease, the system provides a set of possible remedies, including over-the-counter medications, home remedies, or general care instructions.

Technical Approach:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): The user inputs are processed using NLP techniques to extract key symptoms. This helps in understanding the input in a structured form.
Symptom-Disease Mapping: A pre-defined dataset that maps symptoms to diseases is used. The model is trained to predict diseases based on symptom combinations.
Machine Learning Model: The project uses a classification model (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes) to predict diseases based on input symptoms.
Cure Database: A curated database of simple treatments and cures for minor ailments is integrated to offer suggestions based on the predicted disease.

Use Cases:
Quick Diagnosis: The system is useful for users looking for instant advice on minor health issues without the need for a doctorâ€™s consultation.
Home Remedies: It also suggests simple home remedies, which can be helpful for treating minor symptoms without medication.
Health Awareness: It increases users' awareness of potential health conditions and provides them with actionable insights on how to handle early symptoms.

This project can be expanded to cover a wide range of diseases and can serve as a preliminary tool for guiding users toward appropriate healthcare actions.
